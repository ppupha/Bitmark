There have been exceptions [1], but this was the way things were usually done. For an example from my own work, here are three iterations from *Lines 1*, a program from 2017. I initially generated about 200 images from the program, and then curated that down to a final set of just 10 images that I felt captured most of the interesting characteristics.

**The new world**

Today, platforms like Art Blocks (and in the future, Iâ€™m sure many others) allow for something different. The artist creates a generative script (e.g. [Fidenza](https://tylerxhobbs.com/fidenza)) that is written to the Ethereum blockchain, making it permanent, immutable, and verifiable. Next, the artist specifies how many iterations will be available to be minted by the script. A typical choice is in the 500 to 1000 range. When a collector mints an iteration (i.e. they make a purchase), the script is run to generate a new output, and that output is wrapped in an NFT and transferred directly to the collector. Nobody, including the collector, the platform, or the artist, knows precisely what will be generated when the script is run, so the full range of outputs is a surprise to everyone.
Hi

[1] The most notable exceptions are probably "live" programs that could be infinitely refreshed. These share some of the same concerns. With that said, in these new models, the fact that the artist is targeting a specific output set size, combined with the fact that every output will be put up for collection (with no skipping) makes the intent feel significantly different to me.
